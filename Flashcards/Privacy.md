## Federated Learning

### Overview
- Federated Learning is a machine learning approach that trains an algorithm across multiple decentralized devices or servers holding local data samples, without exchanging them. This technique is particularly useful for preserving privacy and reducing the need for data centralization.

### Key Features
- **Privacy Preservation**: By keeping the training data on the device, it minimizes the risk of data leakage and privacy breaches.
- **Reduced Latency**: Local computations reduce the need for data to travel over networks, potentially lowering latency in model updates.
- **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Transmits only model updates (e.g., weights, gradients) instead of raw data, conserving bandwidth.

### Process
1. **Initialization**: A global model is initialized and sent to participating devices.
2. **Local Training**: Each device trains the model on its local data.
3. **Aggregation**: The model updates from all devices are sent to a central server, where they are aggregated to update the global model.
4. **Iteration**: The updated global model is sent back to the devices, and the process repeats until convergence.

### Applications
- **Healthcare**: Securely leveraging patient data across hospitals to improve disease prediction models without sharing sensitive information.
- **Smartphones**: Improving keyboard predictions or app recommendations based on user interaction, without sending personal data to the cloud.

### Challenges
- **System Heterogeneity**: Variations in device hardware and network connections can affect model training and convergence.
- **Statistical Heterogeneity**: Diverse data distributions across devices can challenge the model's ability to learn universally relevant features.

## Federated Learning Training Process
### Training Rounds
1. **Client Selection**: A fraction $C$ of clients are selected randomly at each training round.
   - If $C = 1$, all clients participate in every round, known as full-batch gradient descent.
   - If $C < 1$, a subset of clients participate, known as stochastic gradient descent (SGD).

### Client Computation
- Each client computes the gradient of the loss function $\nabla L_k(\theta)$ with respect to the model parameters $\theta$ using their local data.

### Server Aggregation
- The server aggregates the gradients received from the clients to update the global model.
  $$ \nabla L(\theta) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^{K} n_k \nabla L_k (\theta) $$
  where $n_k$ is the number of data points from the $k^{th}$ client, $N$ is the total number of data points across all clients, and $K$ is the number of participating clients.

### Model Update
- For Federated SGD, the server then updates the local model parameters for each client as:
  $$ \theta_{k}^{j+1} = \theta_{k}^{j} - \tau \nabla L_k (\theta) $$
  where $\tau$ is the learning rate and $j$ indicates the iteration number.

### Federated Averaging (FedAvg)
- The server computes the average of the updated local model parameters to form the new global model.
  $$ \theta^{j+1} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^{K} n_k \theta_{k}^{j+1} $$

### Key Points
- **Decentralization**: The data stays on the client's device, ensuring privacy.
- **Communication Efficiency**: Only model updates are communicated, not the data itself.
- **Scalability**: Can handle a large number of clients due to the stochastic nature of the algorithm.

### Example Use Case
- A predictive text model being trained on users' devices without the text leaving the device.

### Potential Improvements
- Techniques to handle non-IID data distributions and unbalanced data among clients.
- Methods to ensure robustness against clients dropping out or providing poor quality updates.

---
## Unresolved Problems in Federated Learning

### Data Governance Perspective
- These frameworks provide solutions for data sharing issues primarily from a data governance standpoint, allowing data owners to determine the direct consumers of their data.

### Potential Issues
1. **Unbalanced Data Distribution**: Data across clients may not be identically and independently distributed (non-IID), causing models to be biased towards the data distribution of more active participants.
2. **High Update Communication Cost**: Frequent transmission of updates between clients and the central server can be costly, especially in terms of bandwidth and energy consumption.
3. **Lack of Formal Security/Privacy Guarantees**: While federated learning aims to enhance privacy, it may not provide formal guarantees against inference attacks or data reconstruction.
4. **Susceptibility to Adversarial Influence**: Both the server and clients are potential targets for adversaries. Malicious clients can manipulate the learning process, and a compromised server can affect the entire system.

### Summary
Federated learning, while addressing privacy and data governance, still faces significant challenges that can affect the efficiency, security, and overall trustworthiness of the system.

---
## Trust-Related Concerns in Federated Learning

### Privacy Issues
- **Input Privacy**: Protecting the raw data at the client level to ensure it cannot be accessed by unauthorized parties.
- **Output Privacy**: Ensuring that the results of computations (model updates, predictions) do not leak sensitive information.

### Robustness Issues
- **Verification**: Guaranteeing that the model behaves as intended when trained across multiple decentralized datasets.
- **Accountability**: Ensuring that contributions to the training algorithm are traceable and can be linked back to individual parties for transparency and trust.

### Summary
Maintaining trust in federated learning systems involves ensuring privacy at both the input and output stages and establishing robustness through verification and accountability mechanisms.

## K-Anonymity

### Definition
- **K-Anonymity** is a privacy-preserving method aimed at protecting the identity of individuals within a dataset. A dataset is considered k-anonymous if any given record cannot be distinguished from at least \(k-1\) other records with respect to certain identifying attributes.

### Implementation
- **Data Aggregation**: Combining records or adjusting data to make individual records less distinguishable.
- **Suppression**: Removing or blanking out certain values.
- **Generalization**: Replacing specific data with broader categories.

### Drawbacks
1. **Homogeneity Attack**: If the k records in a group are homogeneous in sensitive attributes, knowledge of the group may reveal the sensitive attribute.
2. **Background Knowledge Attack**: An attacker with additional background information can potentially deduce the identity of an individual.
3. **High-Dimensional Data**: K-anonymity becomes difficult to achieve in datasets with many attributes because of the curse of dimensionality.
4. **Data Utility**: Over-generalization can lead to a significant loss of data utility, making the data less useful for analysis.

### Summary
While k-anonymity is a foundational privacy-preserving technique, it may not be sufficient on its own due to potential attacks and the challenge of maintaining data utility.

## Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC)

### Overview
- Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) is a cryptographic protocol that enables parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private.

### Key Concepts
- **Sharding**: In the context of SMPC, sharding refers to the division of secret data into pieces (shards) distributed among different parties. No single party has access to the complete data, ensuring the privacy of the original input.

- **Confidentiality**: SMPC ensures that each party's data input remains confidential. Even though parties work together to compute a function, they do not reveal their individual inputs to each other or any third party.

- **Shared Governance**: It involves collective decision-making and control over the computation process and protocols. No single party can dominate or unilaterally make decisions, contributing to a democratic and equitable system.

### Process
1. Each party encrypts their input.
2. The parties perform computations on encrypted data through a protocol that guarantees the inputs remain hidden.
3. The results are constructed in a way that they can only be decrypted and understood upon agreement of all or a majority of the parties involved.

### Applications
- Financial services for privacy-preserving data analysis and fraud detection.
- Collaboration between different healthcare providers to compute aggregate data analysis without sharing patient data.

### Benefits
- Privacy: Individual data sets are never fully disclosed to other participants.
- Security: SMPC protocols are designed to be secure against various types of cyber-attacks.
- Trust: No trust in a single party is required, as the security does not rely on one participant but on the cryptographic protocol.

### Challenges
- Performance: SMPC can be computationally intensive and may not scale well with a large number of participants or complex functions.
- Complexity: Protocols are complex to implement and require rigorous security considerations.

---## Trusted Execution Environments (TEE)

### Overview
- Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) provide secure areas within a processor. They are designed to protect sensitive code and data from disclosure or modification.

### Key Features
- **Isolation**: TEEs operate separately from the main operating system, providing a secure and isolated execution space.
- **Integrity**: Ensures that the code running within the TEE is protected from tampering.
- **Confidentiality**: Data processed within TEEs is encrypted and inaccessible to the rest of the system, safeguarding against leaks and unauthorized access.

### How it Works
- The processor design includes a secure area that prevents other parts of the device from accessing or interfering with the data or the execution process inside the TEE.
- Cryptographic techniques secure the data and code inside the TEE, and integrity checks prevent tampering.
- Access to the TEE is strictly controlled, with stringent authentication processes in place.

### Use Cases
- **Mobile Payment Applications**: Protect payment credentials and ensure secure transactions.
- **Content Protection**: Secure storage and processing of digital rights management (DRM) keys for media content.
- **Secure Boot**: Verifying the integrity of device boot processes and operating systems.

### Limitations
- While TEEs provide a high level of security, they are not impervious to all types of attacks, especially sophisticated hardware attacks.
- The effectiveness of a TEE relies heavily on the robustness of its implementation and the absence of vulnerabilities in its design.

## Differential Privacy (DP)

### Definition
- Differential Privacy is a system for publicly sharing information about a dataset by describing the patterns of groups within the dataset while withholding information about individuals in the dataset.

### Mathematical Expression
- A process $A$ is $\varepsilon$-differentially private if for all databases $D_1$ and $D_2$ which differ in only one individual, the following holds true:
  $$ \Pr[A(D_1) = O] \leq e^\varepsilon \cdot \Pr[A(D_2) = O] $$
- This inequality ensures that the process $A$ provides a controlled guarantee on the increase in risk of an individual's privacy loss due to their inclusion in the database.

### Epsilon ($\varepsilon$) - Privacy Loss Parameter
- **Epsilon ($\varepsilon$)**: A non-negative parameter that quantifies privacy loss, with smaller values indicating better privacy.

### Usage
- **Epsilon-DP**: Referred to as the 'pure' form of DP, commonly discussed in statistical analysis but rarely implemented in machine learning due to practical challenges.

### Summary
Differential privacy provides a strong privacy guarantee by ensuring the risk to an individual's privacy is bounded, but the strictness of this guarantee (determined by $\varepsilon$) often leads to trade-offs with data utility and is challenging to apply in machine learning.

## Model Inversion

### Definition
- Model Inversion is a type of attack on machine learning models where an attacker uses the model's outputs to reconstruct the model's input data, potentially revealing sensitive information.

### Mechanism
- The attacker exploits internal representations and updates of a joint model to infer details about the training data or individual features.

### Example
- An instance of model inversion is demonstrated in collaborative pneumonia classification, where attackers could potentially reconstruct patient data used in training.

### Risks
- It represents a significant privacy risk, especially in collaborative learning environments where multiple parties contribute data.

### Summary
Model inversion highlights the importance of incorporating robust security measures in the design of machine learning systems to prevent the leakage of private data through model predictions.

---
## Membership Inference Attacks

### Definition
- Membership Inference Attacks involve an attacker determining if a specific data record was used to train a machine learning model.

### Mechanism
- The attacker analyzes the model's predictions, particularly looking at the confidence of the predictions, to infer whether a particular record was in the training dataset.

### Example
- An example of such an attack is determining whether a specific patient's data was included in an HIV-positive dataset used to train a model.

### Risks
- Membership inference attacks pose a serious privacy threat, particularly in healthcare and other sensitive fields where data confidentiality is crucial.

- Strategies to mitigate such attacks include regularizing the model, limiting the detail of the output (e.g., through prediction binning or reducing the precision of probability scores), and using privacy-preserving techniques like Differential Privacy.
- Usynin et al., 2021, "Adversarial interference and its mitigations in privacy-preserving collaborative machine learning," published in *Nature*.

### Summary
Membership inference attacks highlight the need for careful consideration of privacy when designing and deploying machine learning models, as attackers can exploit model outputs to reveal sensitive information about the training data.

---
## Attribute Inference

### Definition
- Attribute Inference Attacks occur when an attacker uses a machine learning model and auxiliary information to deduce sensitive attributes of individuals within the dataset.

### Mechanism
- The attacker leverages the output of a machine learning model in combination with known information (auxiliary data) about an individual to infer other unknown sensitive attributes.

### Example
- An attacker has access to a model trained on patient records and knows some public information about a specific patient. They can then infer private details like the patient's HIV status.

### Risks
- Such attacks can lead to the disclosure of sensitive personal information, posing significant privacy risks.

### Mitigation Reference
- Mitigating these attacks involves careful control over the information the model outputs and possibly applying techniques like Differential Privacy.
- Referenced in Usynin et al., 2021, "Adversarial interference and its mitigations in privacy-preserving collaborative machine learning," *Nature*.

### Summary
Attribute inference attacks highlight vulnerabilities in machine learning systems where seemingly innocuous outputs can be combined with other information to reveal private data.

---
## Model Extraction

### Definition
- Model Extraction Attacks involve an adversary querying a machine learning model to learn about its structure, parameters, and training data in order to recreate a similar model.

### Mechanism
- The adversary uses the predictions and responses from the model to infer its characteristics, which can include the model type, architecture, parameters, and training data insights.

### Risks
- These attacks can result in intellectual property theft, model inversion, and evasion attacks on the original model.

### Mitigation Strategies
- Limiting the number of queries an individual can make, adding random noise to the model's outputs, and monitoring for suspicious patterns of access.

### Summary
Model extraction poses a serious threat to the proprietary nature and security of machine learning models and requires robust defensive measures.

---
## Side-Channel Attacks

### Definition
- Side-Channel Attacks exploit information gained from the physical implementation of a computer system, rather than weaknesses in the implemented algorithms themselves.

### Mechanisms
- These attacks observe indirect aspects such as timing information, power consumption, electromagnetic leaks, or even sound to gain extra information which can be used to break the system.

### Examples
- Timing attacks measure how long it takes a system to respond to certain queries.
- Power-monitoring attacks examine energy consumption patterns during cryptographic operations.

### Risks
- Can lead to the exposure of sensitive data like cryptographic keys, bypassing the need to directly attack the encryption algorithm.

### Mitigation Strategies
- Include designing systems to have constant-time operations, uniform power consumption, and shielding emission of electromagnetic signals.

### Summary
Side-Channel Attacks represent a category of threat that necessitates consideration of a system's physical operational security, not just its software and algorithmic robustness.

---
## Model Poisoning Attacks

### Definition
- Model Poisoning Attacks occur when an attacker introduces subtly altered data into the training set to corrupt the learning process and manipulate the behavior of the model.

### Mechanism
- The malicious data can cause the model to make incorrect predictions, introduce backdoors, or degrade overall performance.

### Risks
- Compromises the integrity of the machine learning model and can be particularly damaging in systems that continuously update their models with new data.

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implementing robust data validation, anomaly detection during training, and secure aggregation protocols in federated learning environments.

### Summary
Model poisoning is a form of attack that targets the training phase of machine learning, underscoring the need for careful data curation and model monitoring.

---
## Backdoor Attacks in Machine Learning

### Definition
- Backdoor Attacks are a form of threat where a machine learning model is tampered with to respond to a specific embedded trigger, causing it to produce incorrect outputs.

### Mechanism
- Attackers insert a backdoor trigger into the training data so that the model learns to associate the trigger with a specific output. When the model encounters the trigger during inference, it produces the output defined by the attacker.

### Risks
- These attacks can go unnoticed during normal operations and can be activated in critical situations, potentially causing significant harm or security breaches.

### Mitigation Strategies
- Regularly scanning and cleaning training datasets, employing anomaly detection techniques, and using robust model validation methods.

### Summary
Backdoor Attacks represent a significant security risk for machine learning systems, necessitating vigilant data and model integrity checks to ensure reliability and trustworthiness.

---
## Evasion Attacks in Machine Learning

### Definition
- Evasion Attacks involve manipulating input data to a machine learning model in a way that causes the model to make incorrect predictions or classifications.

### Mechanism
- At inference time, adversarial examples are crafted by adding carefully designed perturbations to normal inputs that cause the model to misclassify them, often imperceptibly to humans.

### Risks
- They pose a serious risk in security-critical applications, like facial recognition systems or malware detection, where they can be used to bypass controls.

### Mitigation Strategies
- Employing adversarial training, input validation, and robustness testing to improve the model's resistance to such attacks.

### Summary
Evasion Attacks highlight the importance of defensive machine learning strategies to ensure that models remain reliable under adversarial conditions.

## Gradient-based Model Inversion

Gradient-based Model Inversion is a technique used to reconstruct input data given access to a machine learning model's parameters or its gradients with respect to the input. Here's an outline of how it generally works:

### Conceptual Overview:
1. **Model Access**: The attacker needs access to the target model's gradients. In the context of deep learning, this often means having access to the model's architecture and weights.

2. **Target Selection**: The attacker decides on the specific output for which they want to reconstruct the input. For example, this could be a particular class in a classification problem.

3. **Gradient Calculation**: Using backpropagation, the attacker computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to the input. The loss function is chosen such that its minimization would result in the desired output.

4. **Optimization**: The attacker iteratively adjusts an initial input (which could be random noise) to minimize the loss function, guided by the calculated gradients. As the optimization progresses, the input gradually morphs into a form that, when fed into the model, would produce the desired output.

### Steps to Reconstruct Training Data:
1. **Initialize a Dummy Input**: Start with a random noise image or a mean image.

2. **Define the Objective**: Choose the class or output for which the reconstruction is targeted.

3. **Compute Gradients**: Calculate the gradient of the predicted output with respect to the dummy input.

4. **Update the Input**: Adjust the dummy input by a small step in the direction of the gradient. This is akin to reverse-engineering the input that would lead to the targeted output.

5. **Repeat**: Perform many iterations of gradient computation and input updates until the dummy input converges to an image that closely resembles an image from the training data that would be classified as the target class.

6. **Regularization**: Sometimes, regularization techniques are applied to ensure that the reconstructed input remains realistic and doesn't diverge into non-representative noise.

### Considerations:
- **Privacy Risks**: This method can potentially reveal sensitive information if the model has memorized aspects of the training data.
  
- **Defenses**: To defend against such attacks, techniques like differential privacy can be used during training to prevent the model from learning to reproduce inputs too closely.

- **Limitations**: The success of the attack depends on the complexity of the model, the amount of data available, and the level of access to the model's gradients.

Remember that attempting or engaging in such attacks without permission is unethical and illegal. The discussion here is purely academic and intended to raise awareness about machine learning security issues.

## Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD)

### Definition
- DP-SGD is an algorithm that trains machine learning models while providing differential privacy guarantees by adding noise to the gradient descent process.

### Steps
1. **Gradient Computation**: Compute gradients for each individual data sample, representing independent clients.
2. **Gradient Clipping**: Clip gradients to limit their sensitivity, ensuring that each individual's contribution to the overall gradient is bounded.
3. **Noise Addition**: Add Gaussian noise to the clipped gradients, scaled to the sensitivity established by clipping, to ensure differential privacy.
4. **Gradient Descent**: Update the model parameters using the noisy, clipped gradients.

### Purpose
- The purpose of DP-SGD is to minimize the loss function while preserving the privacy of the training data. It allows the model to learn without significantly compromising the data it learns from.

### Reference
- Abadi, Martin, et al. "Deep learning with differential privacy." Proceedings of the 2016 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security. 2016.

### Summary
DP-SGD enables the training of machine learning models with privacy protection, balancing the trade-off between data utility and privacy by carefully tuning the noise scale and gradient clipping.

---
## Machine Learning Security at Scale: Discussion Points

### Scale and Security
- **Client Quantity and Poisoning**: Larger numbers of clients can help disguise malicious data within massive datasets, hindering the detection of poisoning attacks.
- **Device Quantity and Inversion Difficulty**: More devices complicate the task of performing model inversion attacks due to increased variability and data complexity.
- **Client Data Personalization**: With more clients comes more personalized data, increasing the potential for privacy breaches through easier inference.

### Privacy Techniques and Their Trade-offs
- **Differential Privacy (DP) Application**: Implementing DP at scale can enhance privacy but may lead to reduced data utility, making it challenging to balance privacy with model performance.
- **Personalization vs. Privacy**: DP is harder to personalize and can be complex to implement, especially in user-centric models.

### Attack Feasibility and Limitations
- **Inversion Attack Overstatements**: Model inversion attacks often require numerous assumptions to be effective, suggesting they may be less of a threat than sometimes portrayed.
- **Inference Attack Challenges**: While possible at scale, inference attacks face significant obstacles and are not always straightforward.
- **Backdoor Attack Data Requirements**: Introducing backdoors into models might not require extensive data; a small percentage of the dataset could suffice for the attack to be successful.

### Summary
Security concerns in machine learning evolve with scale, presenting both challenges and opportunities for maintaining robust and private models.
