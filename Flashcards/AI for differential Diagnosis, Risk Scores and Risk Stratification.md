# Differential Diagnosis
## What is Differential Diagnosis?

### Definition
- Differential diagnosis, abbreviated as DDx, is the systematic method used in healthcare to identify a disease or condition which a patient likely has by considering and eliminating other possible conditions.

### Process
- Involves a thorough analysis of the patient's history and physical examination results.
- Aims to distinguish one disease from another when multiple diseases share similar clinical features.

### Importance
- Critical for ensuring accurate and timely treatment, especially in cases where symptoms are common to multiple conditions.
- For example, differentiating between common cold symptoms and those related to SARS-CoV-2 is essential due to the treatment and public health implications.

---
## Four Steps for Differential Diagnosis

### Steps in DDx Process
1. **Information Gathering**
   - Collect relevant patient data and compile a comprehensive list of symptoms.
   
2. **Generating Hypotheses**
   - Create a list of potential causes (candidate conditions) for the observed symptoms.
   
3. **Prioritization**
   - Arrange the list of possible diagnoses by considering the risk associated with each diagnosis and its likelihood.
   
4. **Testing**
   - Conduct diagnostic tests to confirm or rule out the conditions listed.

### Iteration
- If the diagnosis remains uncertain, re-evaluate the risks and consider starting empirical treatment based on the most informed hypothesis (an educated best guess).

---
## Common Biases in Clinical Decision-Making

### Biases to Avoid
- **Availability**: Overemphasizing conditions that are more memorable or recently encountered.
- **Anchoring**: Sticking to an initial diagnosis despite new, contradictory evidence.
- **Representativeness**: Choosing the most apparent diagnosis without considering a full differential.
- **Confirmation/Attribution Bias**: Seeking information that confirms preconceptions, while disregarding contradictory data.
- **Premature Closure**: Settling on a diagnosis before all evidence is considered.
- **Framing Effect**: Being swayed by the context or presentation of a situation rather than the facts alone.
- **Momentum**: Being influenced by the diagnostic direction set by others without independent verification.

### Tips for Clinicians
- Remain vigilant of these biases to ensure comprehensive and accurate patient assessment.

## Disease: Signs vs. Symptoms

### Definitions
- **Diagnostic Reasoning**: Associations between diseases and observable indicators.

### Signs
- **Objective Evidence**: Observable and measurable.
- **Examples**: Fever, rash, blood pressure.

### Symptoms
- **Subjective Indications**: Experienced and reported by the patient.
- **Examples**: Pain (headache, abdominal, chest), fatigue, distress.

---
## Hypothetico-Deductive Method in Clinical Diagnosis

### Overview
- **Common Approach**: Widely used by clinicians for diagnostic reasoning.

### Steps
1. **Initial Visit**: Collect basic patient information.
2. **Cue Identification**: Recognize important information as cues.
3. **Hypothesis Formation**: Generate possible explanations based on cues.
4. **Evaluation**: Test hypotheses against findings for a diagnosis.

### Iteration
- **Further Investigation**: If initial hypotheses are inadequate, conduct more tests and gather more data.
- **Repeat Process**: Continue the cycle until a satisfactory diagnosis is reached.

---
## Pattern Matching in Clinical Diagnosis

### Concept
- **Basis**: Relies on recognizing signs or symptoms commonly associated with particular diseases.

### Process
- **Direct Association**: Links patterns of clinical features with therapies, bypassing the need for a differential diagnosis.

### Risks
- **Potential for Error**: Risks missing the correct diagnosis and consequently, the appropriate treatment.

---
## Rule-based Models in Differential Diagnosis

### Rule-based Expert Systems
- **Early Diagnostic Support**: One of the first methods for medical diagnosis, utilizing rules derived from medical knowledge.
- **Components**:
  - **Knowledge Base**: A collection of facts and rules, requiring intensive human input and expertise.
  - **Inference Engine**: Functions like a search engine, matching information from the knowledge base with user queries.
  - **User Interface**: Designed to allow both experts and non-experts to interact with the system effectively.

### Limitations and Evolution
- **Challenges**:
  - Complexity in acquiring and updating the knowledge base.
  - Requires extensive expert domain knowledge and human effort.
  - Traditional if-then-else logic may lack the capacity for uncertainty and probabilistic reasoning.
- **Modern Advances**: Shift from static knowledge bases to dynamic, data-driven models with expert annotations for machine learning, allowing for more nuanced and sophisticated diagnostic support systems.

### Implications
- Expert systems have led to the development of rule learning and classification techniques, making differential diagnosis more efficient and data-driven, albeit still requiring significant expert involvement.

## Probabilistic Approach: Na√Øve Bayes for Differential Diagnosis

### Understanding Probabilities in Diagnosis
- **Disease Probability** ($p(D+)$): The likelihood of having a disease, which can be informed by prevalence rates in the population.
- **Complement** ($p(D-)$): The probability of not having the disease, equal to $1 - p(D+)$.

### Test Results and Probabilities
- **Testing Positive** ($p(T+)$): The probability of a test indicating the presence of a disease.
- **Testing Negative** ($p(T-)$): The probability of a test indicating the absence of a disease.
- **Test Outcomes**:
  - True Positives ($TP$): $p(T+|D+)$
  - False Negatives ($FN$): $p(T-|D+)$
  - False Positives ($FP$): $p(T+|D-)$
  - True Negatives ($TN$): $p(T-|D-)$

### Bayes' Rule
- **Formula**: 
$$
p(B|A) = \frac{p(A|B) p(B)}{p(A)}
$$
- **Application**: Used to update the probability of a disease given a new evidence (test result).

---
## AI's Role in Differential Diagnosis

- **Human vs. AI Approach**: Clinicians often rely on intuition and a deductive process for diagnosis, while AI adopts a more analytical and inductive method.
  
- **Cognitive Factors**: Clinicians' decision-making can be influenced by non-clinical factors such as fatigue, interruptions, and inherent cognitive biases.

- **AI as a Tool**: AI primarily serves to support the diagnostic process, offering objective analysis to supplement the clinician's expertise.

- **Bias in AI**: Despite its objectivity, AI is not immune to biases, which can affect its utility in clinical settings.

- **Expanding Diagnostic Horizons**: AI can assist clinicians by highlighting favored hypotheses and suggesting alternative diagnoses that may not have been initially considered.

# Risk Scores and Stratification
## What are Risk Scores and Stratification?

### Diagnostic Test Evaluation
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) in the population.
- **Sensitivity**: The ability of a test to correctly identify patients with the disease (true positive rate).
- **Specificity**: The ability of a test to correctly identify patients without the disease (true negative rate).
- **Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**: The probability that subjects with a positive screening test truly have the disease.
- **Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**: The probability that subjects with a negative screening test truly don't have the disease.
- **Relative Risk**: The risk of an event (or of developing a disease) relative to exposure.
- **Odds Ratio**: The odds that an event will occur given an exposure, compared to the odds of the event occurring without that exposure.

### Risk Stratification
- A method used to predict a patient's risk of developing a disease or experiencing an event.
- Involves categorizing patients based on the probability of a disease or outcome.

### Case Study: Early Detection of Type 2 Diabetes
- Framed as a supervised learning problem.
- Evaluating algorithms for stratifying patients based on their risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.

## Relative Risk (RR)

### Definition
- Relative Risk, also known as risk ratio, is a measure used in epidemiology to determine how much the risk of a certain event (usually disease) is increased or decreased in a specific group of people (exposed group) compared to another group (non-exposed).

### Formula
$$
RR = \frac{P(\text{outcome | exposure})}{P(\text{outcome | no exposure})}
$$
- "Exposure" usually refers to a specific treatment or intervention.

### Interpretation
- **RR = 1**: The exposure has no effect on the outcome.
- **RR < 1**: The exposure is associated with a decrease in the risk of the outcome (a protective factor).
- **RR > 1**: The exposure is associated with an increase in the risk of the outcome (a risk factor).

Assuming a causal relationship, the RR helps in understanding the strength of association between the exposure and the outcome. 

---
## Odds Ratio (OR)

### Definition
- Odds Ratio is a statistic that quantifies the strength of the association between two events, exposure and outcome. It is used when the relative risk cannot be directly computed, often in case-control studies.

### Calculation
- The odds ratio is the ratio of the odds of the event occurring in the exposed group to the odds of it occurring in the non-exposed group.

### Formula
$$
OR = \frac{D_E / H_E}{D_N / H_N}
$$
- Where $D_E$ is the number of events in the exposed group, $H_E$ is the number of non-events in the exposed group, $D_N$ is the number of events in the non-exposed group, and $H_N$ is the number of non-events in the non-exposed group.

### Example Calculation
- Given:
  - Exposed group events (Disease): 20
  - Exposed group non-events (Healthy): 380
  - Non-exposed group events (Disease): 6
  - Non-exposed group non-events (Healthy): 594
- The OR is calculated as:
$$
OR = \frac{20/380}{6/594} \approx 5.2
$$

### Interpretation
- **OR = 1**: No association between exposure and outcome.
- **OR > 1**: Exposure associated with higher odds of the outcome.
- **OR < 1**: Exposure associated with lower odds of the outcome.

### Note on Prevalence
- Relative risk requires knowledge of prevalence in the whole population, while OR does not.
- In cases of rare diseases, OR and relative risk give similar results.

## Risk Score

### Definition and Purpose
- A **risk score** is a standardized metric that quantifies the likelihood of an individual experiencing a particular healthcare outcome.
- Outcomes may include hospital admissions, emergency visits, or the onset of diseases like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or sepsis.

### Traditional vs. ML-based Risk Scores
- Traditional risk stratification relied on simple scores from basic measurements, exemplified by the **Apgar score** in neonatology.
- In contrast, ML-based risk scores utilize complex, multidimensional data, integrating more seamlessly into clinical workflows with improved accuracy and speed.

### Apgar Score as a Classic Example
- Developed by Dr. Virginia Apgar, it assesses newborns on five criteria: Heart rate, Respiratory effort, Irritability, Tone, and Color.
- It provides an immediate understanding of a newborn's health and helps determine the urgency of intervention.

### Transition to ML-based Risk Scores
- While traditional scores are easy to use, they may not capture nuanced patient data.
- ML approaches can analyze large datasets to uncover patterns and risk factors, leading to more personalized and accurate risk assessments.

### Caution
- Despite their benefits, ML-based scores introduce new risks, such as overfitting, biased data leading to skewed results, and loss of clinician intuition in the diagnostic process.

## Risk Stratification

Risk stratification is a process in healthcare aimed at predicting the likelihood of patients experiencing certain outcomes, which may range from hospital admissions to the development of specific diseases like heart disease or diabetes.

### Key Concepts:
- **Predictive Modeling**: Utilizing data to predict future events.
- **Targeted Interventions**: Implementing strategies focused on individuals identified as high-risk.
- **Outcome Improvement**: Enhancing patient health and reducing healthcare costs through effective stratification.

### Traditional vs. Machine Learning-Based Approaches:

#### Traditional Risk Stratification:
- Based on simple, easily measurable parameters.
- Requires screening steps for every individual, which can be costly and time-consuming.
- Often fails to adapt to missing variables or discover surrogate risk factors.

#### ML-Based Risk Stratification:
- Leverages complex data and machine learning algorithms.
- Can identify missing surrogate risk factors.
- Streamlines the process by fitting into existing workflows with higher accuracy and speed.

#### Population-Level Risk Stratification:
- Utilizes administrative, utilization, and clinical data.
- Performs risk stratification for large groups, enhancing efficiency.

#### Challenges:
- Screening entire populations is impractical and resource-intensive.
- Adjusting models for multiple variables is complex and often requires significant human input.

### Example:
- **Apgar Score**: A traditional and simple risk score assessing newborns' immediate health.

## Differential Diagnosis vs. Risk Stratification

### Differential Diagnosis:
- Active and often iterative process.
- Considers a broad spectrum of possible conditions.
- Must account for rare conditions, possibly using a combination of clinical knowledge and machine learning.

### Risk Stratification:
- Generally a passive process.
- Typically focuses on predicting the likelihood of a single condition.
- Best suited for settings with sufficient data to train models.

### Key Distinctions in Metrics:
- **Relative Risk (RR)**: The likelihood of an event occurring in one group compared to another.
- **Odds Ratio (OR)**: The odds of an event in one group relative to another, demonstrating the strength of association between an exposure and an outcome.

### Data Challenges:
- **Left Censoring (LC)**: Occurs with insufficient data to fully assess a subject's condition.
- **Right Censoring (RC)**: Happens when a subject exits a study before an event occurs, or the study ends before witnessing the event.

### Final Insights:
- Risk stratification and differential diagnosis serve distinct purposes in healthcare, with the former being predictive and the latter diagnostic.
- The understanding of relative risk and odds ratio is crucial for interpreting study outcomes and epidemiological data.
- Censoring in data can impact the accuracy and reliability of risk assessment and research studies.
