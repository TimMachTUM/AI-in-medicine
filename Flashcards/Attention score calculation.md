To compute the self-attention for the given sequence, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Query, Key, and Value vectors** for each input vector by multiplying them with the transformation matrices $Q_q$​, $Q_k$​, and $Q_v$​ respectively.
2. **Compute the dot products of the Query vectors with all Key vectors** to get the scores.
3. **Apply the softmax function** to the scores to get the attention weights.
4. **Multiply the attention weights by the Value vectors** to get a weighted sum, which gives us the output of the attention mechanism for each input.

Given the embedding vectors and transformation matrices, let's proceed with these calculations:
### 1. Query, Key, and Value Vectors
- For ($x_1$):
  - Query vector: $$[-7, -16, 27, 22]$$
  - Key vector: $$[-1, 3, 6, 17]$$
  - Value vector: $$[-5, 2, 12]$$

- For ($x_2$):
  - Query vector: $$[-2, 10, 12, 8]$$
  - Key vector: $$[16, 18, 0, 4]$$
  - Value vector: $$[8, 10, 18]$$

### 2. Dot Product Scores
The scores matrix before softmax, calculated as dot products between Query and Key vectors, is:
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Scores} = \begin{bmatrix}
495 & -312 \\
240 & 180 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$

### 3. Softmax Scores
After applying softmax to normalize the scores, the attention weights are:
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Softmax Scores} = \begin{bmatrix}
1.0 & 0.0 \\
1.0 & 0.0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$

### 4. Final Weighted Sum of Values
- For ($x_1$): The weighted sum of values, which is the output of the self-attention mechanism, is $$[-5, 2, 12]$$.
- For ($x_2$): Similarly, the weighted sum of values is $$[-5, 2, 12]$$.

These results indicate that, due to the extreme values in the softmax scores (where one score dominates completely in both cases, leading to a softmax output of \(1.0\) for one entry and \(0.0\) for the other), each output vector is equal to the value vector corresponding to the first input. This reflects a limitation of using raw dot product scores without scaling (e.g., dividing by \(\sqrt{d_k}\) where \(d_k\) is the dimension of the key vectors) which can lead to very sharp distributions in softmax, effectively making the attention focus on a single vector and ignore the others.
