## Rigid Transformation Model in 3D Image Registration

### Overview of Rigid Transformation

The rigid transformation model is a fundamental approach in 3D image registration that applies rotation and translation to align images without altering their shape or size.

### Key Components of the Rigid Transformation

#### Transformation Function
- **Expression**: The transformation of a voxel coordinate $x$ in 3D space is given by the function:
$$ \phi_{\text{rigid3D}}(x; p) = R_{xyz} \cdot x + t $$

#### 3D Rotation Matrix ($R_{xyz}$)
- **Components**: Composed of rotation matrices around the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes, denoted as $R_x$, $R_y$, and $R_z$ respectively.
- **Combined Rotation**: $$ R_{xyz} = R_z \cdot R_y \cdot R_x $$

#### Rotation Matrices
- **About X-axis ($R_x$)**:
$$
R_x = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\

0 & \sin \alpha & \cos \alpha \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

- **About Y-axis ($R_y$)**:
$$
R_y = \begin{bmatrix}

$$
R_z = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos \gamma & -\sin \gamma & 0 \\
\sin \gamma & \cos \gamma & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$



#### In Homogeneous Coordinates
- **Homogeneous Form**: Incorporates translation into the rotation matrix for computational efficiency:
$$ \phi_{\text{rigid3D}}(x; p) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} & t_x \\
r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} & t_y \\
r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} & t_z \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} \cdot 
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y \\
z \\
1
\end{bmatrix} = R_{xyz\text{t}} \cdot x
$$

#### Parameter Vector ($p$)
- **Definition**: A vector representing the parameters of the transformation, including rotations ($\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$) and translations ($t_x$, $t_y$, $t_z$).
- **Expression**: $p = (\alpha, \beta, \gamma, t_x, t_y, t_z)^T$
### Parametric Image Registration
- **Optimization Problem**: Finding the parameter vector $p$ that best aligns the fixed image $F$ and the moving image $M$:
$$ p^* = \arg\min_{\phi_p} J(F, M \circ \phi_p) $$

#### Mathematical Representation

- **Parameter Vector**: $p \in \mathbb{R}^6$

---
## Affine Transformation Model

The affine transformation model extends the rigid transformation by allowing scaling and shearing, providing a more flexible approach to image alignment.

#### Transformation Function
- **Expression**: The transformation of a voxel coordinate $x$ is given by the function:
$$ \phi_{\text{affine3D}}(x; p) = A \cdot x + t $$

#### 3D Affine Matrix (in Homogeneous Coordinates
- **Composition**: The affine matrix $A$ is the product of shearing, scaling, and rotation matrices:
$$ A = A_{\text{shear}} \cdot A_{\text{scale}} \cdot R_{xyz} $$
- **Shearing Matrix ($A_{\text{shear}}$)** example:
$$ A_{\text{shear}} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & sh_x & 0 \\
0 & 1 & sh_y & 0 \\

0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Local/Non-linear Spatial Transformations

### Local/Non-linear Transformations

Local or non-linear transformations enable detailed and specific adjustments of image regions, providing flexibility that is not possible with global transformations like rigid or affine.

#### Parametric Local Transformation Models
- **Free-Form Deformations via B-Splines**: This method uses B-splines for smooth, continuous interpolations, allowing intricate adjustments of images.

#### B-Spline Basis Functions
- B-splines are utilized due to their smooth and continuous basis functions, which are essential for creating a natural-looking deformation in the image.

#### Construction and Application
- A regular mesh of control points is constructed over the image domain.
- Deformations are applied by manipulating these control points, and the effect on the image is determined by a 3D tensor product of 1D B-splines.

#### Multi-level B-splines
- Increasing the resolution of the control point mesh allows for finer adjustments and more levels of detail, accommodating multi-level B-splines for more sophisticated deformation modeling.

#### Deformation Equation
- The deformation $u(x)$ of a point $x$ is calculated using the sum of B-spline tensor products and the control points' displacement:
$$ u(x) = \sum_{l=0}^{3} \sum_{m=0}^{3} \sum_{n=0}^{3} B_l(u) B_m(v) B_n(w) c_{i+l,j+m,k+n} $$

- Where $B_0(s), B_1(s), B_2(s), B_3(s)$ are the B-spline basis functions defined for the interval $[0,1]$.

#### Non-parametric Transformation
- **Model**: A transformation $\phi$ from the domain $\mathbb{R}^d$ to $\mathbb{R}^d$.
- **Function**: Defined by $\phi(x) = x + u$, where $x$ is the original coordinate and $u$ is the displacement vector.

#### Displacement Fields
- **Displacements**: Represented by $u \in \mathbb{R}^d$, indicating the movement from the original position.
- **Dense Fields**: Dense displacement fields describe the deformation at every point in the domain, providing detailed local deformation.

#### Deformation Field
- The transformation model itself is the deformation field, representing the vector field of displacements across the image space.

## Image Warping - Forward and Backward Mapping

### Image Warping

Image warping involves transforming the spatial arrangement of an image to align with another or to correct distortions.

### Forward Mapping (Lagrangian Approach
- **Concept**: Each point from the source image is moved forward to its corresponding location in the destination image.
- **Process**: It involves iterating through source image pixels and mapping them to new locations, which can lead to gaps or overlaps if the mapping is not one-to-one.
- **Challenge**: Handling holes (pixels with no values assigned) and overlaps (multiple source pixels assigned to the same target pixel) requires additional steps like interpolation or decision rules.

### Backward Mapping (Eulerian Approach
- **Concept**: For each point in the destination image, the corresponding source image pixel is found by tracing backward.
- **Process**: It starts with the destination image and for each pixel computes where it would come from in the source image, often requiring interpolation since the backward-mapped location may not align with the source grid.
- **Advantage**: This method naturally avoids holes and overlaps, as every destination pixel is accounted for and sourced from the original image.

## Mono-modal Image Similarity Measures

### Sum-of-Square-Differences (SSD) and Mean-Squares-Error (MSE)
- **SSD and MSE** are used to measure similarity by comparing the square differences between corresponding pixels in the two images.
- **Assumption**: They assume an identity relationship between the image intensities in both images, which means the same structures should have the same intensity.
- **Optimization Function**: The SSD is defined as:
$$ D_{SSD}(F, M \circ \phi) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (F(x_i) - (M \circ \phi)(x_i))^2 $$
- **Characteristics**: 
  - SSD/MSE is an optimal measure if the difference between both images is Gaussian noise.
  - These measures are sensitive to outliers, meaning that significant differences between a few pairs of pixels can disproportionately affect the measure.

### Normalized Cross Correlation (NCC
- **NCC** assesses the linear relationship between image intensities, accounting for differences in image brightness or contrast.
- **Assumption**: NCC assumes a linear relationship between image intensities and is particularly useful if images have different intensity windowing.
- **Optimization Function**: The NCC is defined as:
$$ D_{NCC}(F, M \circ \phi) = \frac{\sum_{i} (F(x_i) - \mu_F)((M \circ \phi)(x_i) - \mu_M)}{\sqrt{\sum_{i} (F(x_i) - \mu_F)^2 \sum_{i}((M \circ \phi)(x_i) - \mu_M)^2}} $$
- **Characteristics**: 
  - NCC is less sensitive to outliers compared to SSD and MSE.
  - It is normalized, making it robust to linear changes in the intensity scale.

### Usage in Optimization
- These similarity measures serve as objective functions in optimization problems for image registration.
- The goal is to adjust the transformation parameters $\phi$ to maximize (for NCC) or minimize (for SSD/MSE) the objective function, leading to the best alignment of the images.

## Multi-modal Image Similarity Measures

### SSD and MSE

### Normalized Gradient Fields (NGF)
- **Purpose**: NGF is a similarity measure designed for multi-modal image registration.
- **Assumption**: It assumes that intensity changes occur at the same locations across the images, making it suitable for comparing images where the same structures may have different intensities due to different imaging modalities.
- **Optimization Function**: The NGF similarity measure is defined as:
$$ D_{NGF}(F, M \circ \phi) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (n(F, x_i) \times n(M \circ \phi, x_i))^2 $$
- **Normalized Gradients**: The gradients of the images are normalized to unit vectors where the gradient is non-zero:
$$ n(I, x) = \begin{cases} \frac{\nabla I(x)}{\| \nabla I(x) \|}, & \nabla I(x) \neq 0 \\ 0, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} $$
- **Characteristics**: 
  - NGF is effective in situations where traditional intensity-based similarity measures may not perform well due to the different modalities.
  - By focusing on gradient information rather than intensity values, NGF can better align images by the edges and textures which are often consistent across modalities.

### Shannon Entropy
- **Concept**: Measures the amount of information or uncertainty in an image.
- **Application**: Used to quantify the randomness or complexity in the intensity distribution of a single image.

### Joint Entropy
- **Concept**: Quantifies the combined information or uncertainty of two images when considered jointly.
- **Application**: In image registration, it measures how well two images are aligned by considering their combined intensity distributions.

### Mutual Information (MI)
- **Concept**: Measures the amount of information that one image contains about another.
- **Formula**: Defined as the difference between the sum of individual entropies and the joint entropy:
$$ MI(F, M) = Entropy(F) + Entropy(M) - JointEntropy(F, M) $$
- **Application**: An optimal measure for multi-modal image registration, as it assumes a statistical relationship between the images rather than a direct intensity correspondence.

### Normalized Mutual Information (NMI)
- **Concept**: Normalizes mutual information to account for differences in image complexity.
- **Formula**: Typically defined as the sum of individual entropies divided by the joint entropy, which normalizes the mutual information with respect to the image entropies:
$$ NMI(F, M) = \frac{Entropy(F) + Entropy(M)}{JointEntropy(F, M)} $$
- **Application**: Provides a more robust measure that is less sensitive to variations in image overlap or content, making it widely used in medical image registration.

## Regularization in Image Registration

### Purpose of Regularization
- **Concept**: Regularization introduces additional information or constraints to stabilize the image registration process.
- **Goal**: To prevent overfitting to noise and artifacts, ensuring physically plausible and smooth deformation fields.

### Regularization in Mono-modal Registration
- **Smoothness Constraint**: Often used to ensure that the transformation is smooth, which is particularly important when dealing with noisy images or when the transformation is complex, like in non-rigid registration.
- **Function**: Typical regularization functions include Tikhonov regularization, which penalizes the magnitude of the transformation's derivatives, ensuring small local deformations, or elastic regularization, which mimics the physical properties of elastic materials.

### Regularization in Multi-modal Registration
- **Modality Invariance**: Regularization in multi-modal registration often includes terms that are invariant to changes in modality, such as the gradients of the transformation rather than the intensities.
- **Joint Histogram Smoothing**: For methods like mutual information, regularization may also involve smoothing the joint histogram to avoid local maxima due to noise.

### Methods of Regularization
- **Discrete Methods**: Regularization can be achieved by imposing penalties on the discrete parameters of the transformation, such as the movement of control points in spline-based methods.
- **Continuous Methods**: For methods that model the transformation as a continuous field, regularization often involves differential operators like the Laplacian to enforce smoothness.

### Optimization
- Regularization terms are integrated into the optimization problem and balanced with the similarity measure through a weighting parameter (often denoted as lambda, $\lambda$).
- The choice of regularization term and the weighting parameter is crucial for the performance of the registration algorithm and is often selected based on the characteristics of the images and the application requirements.

## Spatial Transformers
Spatial transformers are a neural network component introduced by Google DeepMind in 2015 that explicitly allows the spatial manipulation of data within the network. This differentiable module can be inserted into existing convolutional architectures, enabling the network to learn how to perform tasks of spatial transformation on data in an end-to-end manner. Here’s a breakdown of their functionality:

### Components of a Spatial Transformer:

1. Localization Network
    
    - Learns the transformation parameters from the input data. It outputs the parameters of the spatial transformation that should be applied. The transformation can be affine or more complex, such as scaling, cropping, rotations, or non-rigid deformations.
2. Grid Generator
    
    - Uses the parameters output by the localization network to create a sampling grid. This grid defines the mapping from the output space back to the input space, i.e., it figures out which points in the input map to points in the output.
3. Sampler
    
    - Takes the input feature map and the grid generated by the grid generator and produces the transformed output feature map. The sampler uses the grid to look up the values from the input feature map, applying bilinear interpolation to compute the values at the grid points.

### Key Characteristics:

- **Differentiability**: The spatial transformer module is fully differentiable, making it suitable for standard backpropagation training. This is crucial for its use in deep learning models.
    
- **Modularity**: It can be plugged into virtually any neural network architecture, especially those that benefit from spatial invariance properties.
    
- **Learned Invariance**: Unlike traditional techniques that use fixed spatial invariance such as pooling layers, spatial transformers can learn invariance, leading to more flexible models.

A neural network architecture for supervised image registration typically follows an end-to-end learning approach, where the network is trained to align pairs of source and target images using ground truth transformations or aligned image pairs as supervision. Here's a general description of such an architecture:

### Input Layer:

- The input to the network consists of pairs of images: a fixed (reference) image and a moving (source) image that needs to be aligned with the fixed image.

### Feature Extraction Layers:

- These layers typically consist of a series of convolutional layers that extract features from both the fixed and moving images. In some architectures, two separate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) called siamese networks extract features from each image independently, while others may share weights between the paths for both images.

### Transformation Prediction Layer (Localization Network):

- A localization network follows the feature extraction layers and predicts the spatial transformation parameters required to align the moving image with the fixed image. This can be a fully connected layer or a series of such layers that output parameters such as rotation, translation, scale, or even deformation field vectors for non-rigid transformations.

### Spatial Transformer Layer:

- This layer uses the predicted transformation parameters to warp the moving image to align it with the fixed image. This module is differentiable and hence allows for gradient flow back through the transformation parameters during training.

### Loss Function:

- The loss function is crucial in supervised learning. For image registration, it often measures the similarity between the warped moving image and the fixed image. Common choices for the loss function include mean squared error, cross-correlation, or more advanced measures like mutual information, depending on whether the registration is mono-modal or multi-modal.

### Regularization Term:

- To ensure smooth and plausible transformations, a regularization term may be included in the loss function. This term can penalize excessive local deformations or enforce smoothness constraints on the predicted transformation field.

### Output Layer:

- The output of the network is the transformed (registered) image, which is then compared to the fixed image to calculate the loss during training.

### Training:

- During training, the network learns to minimize the loss function by adjusting its weights using backpropagation. The ground truth data can come from manually aligned image pairs or synthetic transformations applied to images.

### Example Architectures:

- **U-Net**: Originally designed for biomedical image segmentation, U-Net and its variants have been successfully adapted for image registration tasks, mainly due to their powerful feature extraction and upscaling capabilities that preserve spatial information.
    
- **VoxelMorph**: A specific architecture designed for image registration, which uses a U-Net-like structure with a convolutional network for

### Architecture Components

1. **Input Layer**:
   - Accepts a pair of 3D images: a fixed image and a moving image.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Uses a series of convolutional layers to extract features from both images. It typically adopts an encoder-decoder structure similar to a U-Net, with skip connections to preserve spatial information.

3. **Localization Network**:
   - A sub-network that predicts the parameters of the deformation field required to align the moving image with the fixed image. It outputs a dense, non-linear 3D deformation field.

4. **Sampling Layer (Spatial Transformer)**:
   - Applies the predicted deformation field to the moving image to produce the registered image. This layer uses a differentiable grid sampling mechanism to enable end-to-end learning.

5. **Loss Function**:
   - A composite loss function that often includes:
     - A similarity term (such as cross-correlation) measuring how well the registered moving image matches the fixed image.
     - A regularization term that encourages smooth transformations and penalizes unrealistic deformations.

### Training Strategy

- **Unsupervised Learning**:
  - VoxelMorph is trained on a dataset of image pairs without ground truth deformation fields, learning to optimize the transformation based on the similarity and regularization terms.

### Output

- **Deformation Field**:
  - A 3D volume where each voxel contains a vector indicating the displacement from the moving image to the fixed image.

- **Registered Image**:
  - The transformed moving image, which has been deformed according to the predicted deformation field to align with the fixed image.

## Multi-Resolution Networks

#### Concept of Multi-Resolution
- Multi-resolution networks are designed to process data at multiple scales or resolutions, typically to capture both global and local context effectively. This approach is particularly useful in tasks where features of interest vary significantly in size and detail, such as in image analysis and signal processing.

#### Architecture Overview
- **Pyramidal Structure**: These networks often have a pyramidal structure where the input data is processed at various resolutions, starting from coarse (low resolution) to fine (high resolution) levels.
- **Downsampling and Upsampling**: The architecture includes downsampling layers to reduce the resolution and capture large-scale features, and upsampling layers to recover detail and refine predictions at higher resolutions.

#### Features and Benefits
- **Hierarchical Feature Integration**: By working at multiple resolutions, the network can integrate contextual information from larger receptive fields with detailed local information from smaller receptive fields.
- **Efficiency**: Processing at lower resolutions reduces computational load and memory usage, which can speed up the training and inference processes.

#### Components in Image Processing
- **Encoder**: Captures context by reducing spatial dimensions while increasing the feature dimensions, often using convolutional and pooling layers.
- **Decoder**: Recovers spatial information by increasing spatial dimensions and refining features, often using transposed convolutions or unpooling layers.
- **Skip Connections**: Transfer fine-grained information from the encoder to the decoder to preserve high-resolution details.

#### Training and Optimization
- Networks may be trained end-to-end with loss functions applied at different resolutions to ensure accurate feature capture at all levels.
- Careful design is needed to balance the flow of information across scales and to prevent the vanishing gradient problem during backpropagation.

## HyperMorph: Hypernetworks for Medical Image Registration

#### Overview
- HyperMorph integrates hypernetworks into the image registration process, enabling the model to adjust its parameters specifically for each pair of images it aligns.

#### Architecture Components
- **Primary Network (Registration Network)**: 
  - This is the main neural network responsible for predicting the deformation field that registers the moving image to the fixed image.
  
- **Hypernetwork**: 
  - A secondary neural network that takes in attributes of the input image pair (such as anatomical features, differences in acquisition parameters, etc.) and outputs the weights for the primary registration network.
  
- **Attribute Input**: 
  - Attributes of the image pair that are relevant for registration are fed into the hypernetwork. These attributes can be manually defined features or learned representations.

#### Functionality
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: 
  - For each new image pair, the hypernetwork predicts a unique set of weights for the registration network, effectively customizing the registration model for each specific task.
  
- **Weight Prediction**: 
  - Instead of using a fixed set of parameters for all registrations, HyperMorph allows the network to adapt its parameters for individual pairs, potentially leading to more accurate and robust registrations.

#### Training and Inference
- **End-to-End Learning**: 
  - The entire model, including the hypernetwork and the primary network, is trained in an end-to-end fashion using a dataset of image pairs.
  
- **Loss Functions**: 
  - The training process may involve a composite loss function that includes terms for registration accuracy, transformation smoothness, and possibly a regularization term for the complexity of the hypernetwork-generated weights.

#### Advantages
- **Personalization**: 
  - By generating personalized weights for each registration task, HyperMorph can potentially handle a wide range of variations in images, such as different disease states, patient demographics, or imaging modalities.
  
- **Flexibility**: 
  - The hypernetwork can learn to adjust the registration network for various factors, making the approach flexible and powerful for diverse registration challenges.

#### Applications
- **Medical Image Analysis**: 
  - HyperMorph can be particularly beneficial in medical imaging, where the need for personalized registration is paramount due to high inter-patient variability.

## Summary
### Conventional Image Registration
- **Technique**: Typically involves iterative optimization to find the best transformation that aligns the moving image with the fixed image.
- **Flexibility**: Can handle a wide range of transformations, including linear (rigid, affine) and non-linear (elastic, diffeomorphic) mappings.
- **Computational Cost**: Often computationally intensive due to iterative optimization, especially for non-linear registration.
- **Robustness**: May require careful initialization and parameter tuning to avoid local minima and ensure convergence to a good solution.
- **Interpretability**: Offers clear interpretability of the transformation parameters and the optimization process.
- **Dependency**: Heavily dependent on the choice of similarity measures (e.g., mutual information, cross-correlation) and regularization terms.

### Deep Learning-Based Image Registration
- **Technique**: Utilizes neural networks, typically CNNs, to learn the registration function from data, often in an end-to-end manner.
- **Speed**: Once trained, can perform registration in a single forward pass, which is significantly faster than iterative optimization.
- **Data-Driven**: Requires a large amount of training data but can learn complex patterns and transformations from this data.
- **Generalization**: A well-trained model can generalize to new images, but performance may degrade if the new images deviate significantly from the training set.
- **Interpretability**: Often considered a "black box" approach due to the complexity and depth of the network, making it hard to interpret the learned features and transformations.
- **Dependency**: Relies on the availability of labeled training data or unsupervised learning approaches that can learn from the data distribution itself.

### Similarities
- **Objective**: Both aim to find the best transformation that aligns the moving image to the fixed image.
- **Usage**: Used in various applications, including medical imaging, remote sensing, and computer vision.
- **Transformation Models**: Both can utilize similar transformation models, such as affine or non-linear deformations.

### Differences
- **Approach**: Conventional methods rely on mathematical models and optimization techniques, while deep learning methods rely on data-driven feature learning.
- **Training and Inference**: Conventional methods do not require training and perform optimization at inference time, while deep learning methods require training but offer faster inference.
- **Performance**: Deep learning methods may outperform conventional methods in terms of speed and can potentially learn more complex transformations directly from data.
- **Resource Requirements**: Deep learning methods require significant computational resources for training, including GPUs and large datasets, whereas conventional methods are more reliant on the computational resources during the registration process itself.

In summary, conventional image registration methods are characterized by their mathematical rigor and interpretability but are often slower due to iterative optimization. In contrast, deep learning-based methods are fast at inference and excel at handling complex, data-driven transformations but require substantial training data and computational resources, and they offer less interpretability.
